# Springboard_CS_LinearRegression

Statistical Modeling in Python
In this last subunit, you'll gain experience implementing linear regression in Python. This is seriously cool stuff here. Linear regression is a paradigm of statistical modeling that has seen a huge resurgence in popularity recently. As a data scientist, you'll be using linear regression as often as a carpenter uses a hammer. The first case study in this subunit explores which red wines have properties that make them more alcoholic.  The second case study, on housing in Boston, is optional but worthwhile if you'd like more practice.
